          <h2>Threads</h2>
          Threads is an American social media platform and social networking service owned and operated by Meta Platforms. The app offers users the ability to post and share text, images, and videos, as well as to interact with other users' posts through replies, reposts, and likes. Closely linked to the Meta platform Instagram and additionally requiring users to both have an Instagram account and use Threads under the same Instagram handle, Threads functionality is similar to Twitter and has further been described as a "Twitter killer”. The application is available on iOS and Android devices with full functionality, while the web version offers limited functionality. It gained 100 million users within its first five days, surpassing the record previously set by ChatGPT.
          After Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, Meta employees explored the concept of introducing text-based functionality to Instagram. This feature, known as Instagram Notes, was rolled out in December 2022. The company subsequently began developing a separate app focused on text-based posts. Development on Threads—internally known as "Project 92"—commenced in January 2023, with the platform officially launching on July 5, 2023. Threads accounts are closely integrated with Instagram accounts. By default, Threads and Instagram accounts share the same username, profile picture, and display name, although the profile picture and display name can be customized. Users can choose which accounts they follow on Instagram will carry over to Threads, either with the other person's Threads account already created or set to automatically follow them once an account is created. As of July 2023, if a user decides to terminate their Threads account, they must delete their associated Instagram account as well. Adam Mosseri, the CEO of Instagram, has acknowledged this limitation and stated that they are exploring options for a user to delete only their Threads account.
          Users are required to have an Instagram account to use Threads. Threads is a companion app to Instagram, and it uses Instagram to authenticate the user's identity and connect with their network.
          Threads immediately became available in 100 countries but have delayed its launch in the European Union as it waits for regulatory clarity from the European Commission regarding the service's data collection policies. Mark Zuckerberg just announced the initial version of Threads, an app built by the Instagram team for sharing text. Whether you’re a creator or a casual poster, Threads offers a new, separate space for real-time updates and public conversations. We are working toward making  Threads compatible with the open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the Internet.
          Instagram is where billions of people around the world connect over photos and videos. Our vision with Threads is to take what Instagram does best and expand that to text, creating a positive and creative space to express your ideas. Just like on Instagram, with Threads you can follow and connect with friends and creators who share your interests – including the people you follow on Instagram and beyond. And you can use our existing suite of safety and user controls.
